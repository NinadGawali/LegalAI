# LegalAI
LegalAI is an intelligent legal assistant that allows users to upload legal documents and interact with them seamlessly using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages FAISS for efficient vector storage and similarity search, combined with LangChain and the Gemini 2.5 model for advanced legal reasoning and natural language responses.
